        <h3>Introduction</h3>
      </main>  <p>The primary dataset we utilize All Space Missions from 1957 Dataset offers a comprehensive examination of the evolution 
            of space exploration and its significant milestones. This examination begins with the Soviet Union's pioneering Sputnik 
            launch in 1957, an event that ignited the Space Race primarily between the Soviet Union and the United States. Sourced 
            from Next Spaceflight, our dataset encompasses records of 4,287 space missions, detailing launch dates, mission names, 
            organizing bodies, launch sites, outcomes, mission types, destinations, and available cost data. Below is a sample from 
            the dataset, illustrating the structured information it contains. It's important to note that the dataset is predominantly 
            clean, with only a few entries containing null values as you can see from the sample figure.
